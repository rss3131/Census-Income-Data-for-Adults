# Census-Income-Data-for-Adults


I used census income data here to apply data engineering. For example, I removed outliers, split the data into training and test sets, created binary classifiers, built confusion matrix, and calculated the accuracy and made predictions.


Some of the key features used in this work are: 
• Joined data frames
• Summarized the given data
• Split the data into training and validation set with a ratio of 70 and 30 for the training and validation dataset, respectively.
• Used the NaiveBayes classification algorithm and predicted the values
• Built the confusion matrix to understand the different features of dataset such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value
